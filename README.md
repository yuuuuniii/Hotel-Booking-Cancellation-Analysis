# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis

## 🎯Background
The relevance of studying booking cancellations in the hospitality industry cannot be overstated, especially as the sector evolves with increasing customer expectations and competition. Analyzing factors like car parking availability, room rates, and lead generation time is crucial because these elements significantly influence customer decisions. For instance, guests may prefer hotels with parking for convenience, and pricing sensitivity can vary widely among different customer segments, affecting their likelihood to cancel reservations.

## 🎯Problem Statement
In the post-pandemic era, predicting revenue has become increasingly challenging for the accommodation industry. Consequently, it is crucial for accommodation companies to accurately interpret and analyze the primary factors contributing to booking cancellations to maximize their revenue potential.

## 🎯Goal
Our objective is to utilize the provided models—KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Bagged Tree—to predict cancellation rates at hotels. These models will be employed by stakeholders to optimize the company's revenue.

We anticipate that the primary stakeholder will be the Marketing & Sales Department. This department is responsible for maximizing revenue by implementing key marketing strategies targeted at customers. By leveraging these models, they can identify the right customer segments and the main factors contributing to cancellations, thereby maximizing the company's profits.
